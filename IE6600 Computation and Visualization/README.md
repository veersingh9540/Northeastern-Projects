   - Tools : R programming, R shiny, Tidyverse
   - Dataset: With a dataset like the "Bank Marketing Dataset" from the "UCI Machine Learning dataset," we intend to create an interactive web dashboard.Increased visualization of the needed information. This dataset's nearly 45k instances make it incredibly helpful. That will suffice to complete the task.

    - Examine the demographics of each campaign's audience.
    - Projection of all pertinent future trends.
    - Foreseeing the modification of patterns (If any).
 - Methods:
     - We initially intend to clean the data in the necessary format, which in this instance will take the shape of a "Tibble"
     - You can accomplish that by utilizing "Tidyverse" and "readr". Using tidyverse, you can complete any other task, including gathering, sorting, scattering, and so on.
     - The “ggplot” package is sufficient for interactive data visualization, however “rshiny” must be used as part of our project to create a webpage..
     - We also use the "Lubridate" package to handle date-and-time data.
